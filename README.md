A set of 3 social media apps

Here are 3 NFT social media platforms I would like to build:


written

An app similar to Twitter, but the character limit is 5000 char. And, every post is an NFT. Users can put their post up for auction, or users can make offers. When a post is sold, it now appears on the new owner’s feed.

mirror

An app similar to TikTok, but with the ability to post videos up to 45 min long. It wouldn’t have filters and other silly stuff, it would be aimed more toward allowing people to upload well produced content. The likes and other controls disappear after a few seconds of viewing, so the content alone is featured. Users could also shoot things wide-angle, and upload their own show. Every post is an NFT, and can be put up for auction or made offers on.

reflection

An app similar to Instagram, but every post is an NFT. Users can put a piece up for auction, or others can make offers. When a post is sold, it then appears on the new owner’s feed.
